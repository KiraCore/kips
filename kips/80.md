# KIP-80: Governance Polls


## Concept 


To achieve an off-chain consensus over a range of known or unknown choice options we need to create a new type of proposal - `Poll Proposal`. The Poll Proposal will enable a particular set of known individuals to either submit their own voting option or vote on one of the already proposed ones. Our goal here is to cover maximum possible number of use cases, such as agreeing on upgrade time, selecting group admins, future changes to be applied to the network properties registrar, etc. 


## Implementation 


### I. Proposing & Voting Rights 


Since KIRA governance is divided into potentially unlimited number of sub-groups through the use of `Roles`, we have to enable each individual role holder to create their own Poll. This will be achieved through a dedicated `createPollPermission`. If the `createPollPermission` is assigned to the account as individual permission or as a sub-component of a Role that is assigned to some account, then such account should be allowed to create their own Poll. 


The Poll Proposal opposed to other types of KIRA proposals will NOT have a corresponding `votePollPermission`, instead a person raising a proposal should have ability to decide which other Role or Roles should have the ability to vote on the specific Poll in the form of whitelist and/or whitelist.


### Ii. Creating Polls 


Each poll should constitute of the following elements: 

- `title` - short title as for any other proposals (should be limited to `128 characters`)
	- NOTE: If not already present add Network Property[broken link], which defines title character limit for all proposals (`max_proposal_title_size`)
		- Ensure that character limit is enforced for **all** proposals
- `description` - short description as for any other proposals describing expected issue to be voted on (should be limited to `1024 characters`)
	- NOTE: If not already present, add Network Property[broken link], which defines description character limit for all proposals (`max_proposal_description_size`)
		- Ensure that character limit is enforced for **all** proposals
- `reference` - IPFS CID or URL reference to file describing proposal and voting options in depth (should be limited to `512 characters`)
- `checksum` - reference checksum (should be limited to `128 characters`)
- `roles` - list of roles that are allowed to take part in the poll vote
- `options.values` - list of options that governance members can vote on (should be limited to `64 characters` each item and have no less than `1` character)
	- Add Network Property[broken link], which defines option character limit for all proposals (`max_proposal_poll_option_size`)
		- Ensure that character limit is enforced for **Poll** proposals
	- Must be case insensitive
	- Cannot start or end with any whitespace characters
	- Only ASCII characters are allowed
- `options.count` - maximum number of voting options that poll can have (this is necessary since we want to allow user provide their own voting option)
	- Add Network Property[broken link], which defines option count limit for **Poll** proposals (`max_proposal_poll_option_count`, default `128`)
- `options.type` - type of the options, all user supplied or predefined options must match its type
	- Option types: `string`, `uint`, `int`, `float`, `bool`
- `options.choices` - should define maximum number of choices that voter can select (default `1`)
- `expiry` - time when new votes can no longer be casted

**Example Data Structure:**


```json
{
	"title": "My example Poll :)",
  "description": "What kind of cookie should Bob eat?",
	"reference": "bafybeifiixdxq4cli6qxib5zfiky7rilb6k66f336nymj4jty6tdsiixre", // example CID
  "checksum": "f5aca3b1fafffdcf22a30aafd3392e473592944da28515ae0a06afbc71c27b09", // example sha256
	"roles": [ "sudo", "validator", "ambassador" ],
	"options": {
		"values": [
			"blueberry",
	    "chocolate",
	    "vanilla",
	    "Bob is too fat to have a cookie"
		],
   "count": 4, // default (if not specified) should be equal to length of options array
   "type": "string",
   "choices": 1
	}
}
```


### Iii. Voting Results & Rules 


All voting logic should follow existing Proposals Logic[broken link] voting rules, with exception for results & vote type, since the vote types will have a wider range - as per voter-supplied or pre-defined `options` in our case.

- Each account with ability to vote should have the right to one and only one vote, the vote can be changed at any time by sending another vote tx (just like in the case of other proposals)
- One vote can correspond to ONE or MANY voting options as per `options.choices` variable
- Voters should be allowed to cast custom choices if `options.count` is greater than `options.values.length`
	- Custom choices should be added to `options.values` so that other users can vote on them
- One voter can NOT vote multiple times on the same option
- It should be allowed to vote `abstain` and `veto` regardless of the defined `options.values` and the `abstain/veto` should be a reserved values, that doesn’t have to match the `options.type`
- Proposal is **passed/successful** only if `vote_quorum` is reached as defined by Network Properties[broken link] and one of the options has majority votes
- Proposal is **rejected** if majority of votes are `veto` votes, the quorum is NOT reached or more then one non veto `options.values` has the same number of votes (indecisive result).
- Poll proposals should be instant and NOT have enactment time
- Proposal can't pass, be rejected or vetoed before its `expiration` time passes unless all voters cast their vote and result would NOT be indecisive.

Finalized proposal should record all options voted on, their corresponding scores, final result, time of creation, contents & end time. We do NOT need to record/persist which user voted on which option.


## Transactions & Queries  


List of essential transactions & queries

- `polls-list-by-address` - list all polls by `address` that can vote on them, if address is not specified list all polls
	- Ensure that all polls are also visible in the already existing proposals query and that they can be queried by proposal id
- `poll-create` - create a poll
- `poll-vote` - vote on the poll

## Notes 

- Ensure compatibility with KIP-81[broken link] in development by @Anonymous
